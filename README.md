Up-Air Bridges Calculator
=========================

This is a small interactive program that calculates the frame data of the first 5 up-airs in Pikachu's full up-air combo.

To run it, first set up a virtualenv and install pygame:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements
```

Then you can run it:
```sh
python3 bridges.py
```
